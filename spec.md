# Developer Specification: Breaking Grounds Network SPA

## Overview

Build and deploy a simple, vibrant, and responsive Single Page Application (SPA) using React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend). The app will display a hardcoded welcome message, include a header and fixed footer with placeholder text, and be deployed to Azure App Service using a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub + Azure Pipelines). The pipeline must run basic unit tests and block deployment on test failure.

---

## Functional Requirements

- **Frontend**
  - Display a hardcoded welcome message:  
    `Welcome to Breaking Grounds Network`
  - Use vibrant colors for styling to keep users engaged.
  - Include a simple header and a fixed footer, both with placeholder text.
  - Ensure the layout is responsive for desktop and mobile.
  - Basic accessibility (semantic HTML, reasonable contrast).

- **Backend**
  - Node.js with Express.
  - Serve the React build in production.
  - Expose a simple health check route (e.g., `GET /api/health`) that returns a JSON status.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accessibility:** Basic (semantic HTML, reasonable contrast).
- **Performance:** Fast initial load; serve static files efficiently.
- **Security:** Use recommended Express security middleware (e.g., helmet, CORS).
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Frontend: Display a generic error message if the app fails to load.
  - Backend: Return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error messages for server errors.

---

## Architecture

- **Monorepo**:  
  - `client/` — React app (using Create React App)
  - `server/` — Node.js/Express app
  - Single root `package.json` managing all dependencies and scripts

- **Production Build**:  
  - React app is built and output to `client/build/`
  - Express serves static files from `client/build/`
  - All non-API routes fallback to `index.html` for SPA routing

---

## Data Handling

- No persistent data storage required.
- All content is hardcoded.
- Health check endpoint returns static JSON (e.g., `{ status: "ok" }`).

---

## Error Handling Strategy

- **Frontend**
  - Use React error boundaries for unexpected errors.
  - Show a user-friendly error message if the app fails to render.

- **Backend**
  - Use Express error-handling middleware.
  - Return JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500).

---

## Testing Plan

- **Frontend**
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library.
  - At least one test to verify the welcome message renders.

- **Backend**
  - Use Jest (or Mocha/Chai).
  - At least one test to verify the health check endpoint returns the expected JSON.

- **CI/CD**
  - All tests must pass before deployment proceeds.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **Source Control:** GitHub
- **Pipeline:** Azure Pipelines (YAML)
- **Steps:**
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Run all tests (client and server)
  3. Build the React app
  4. Deploy both client and server as a single Node.js app to Azure App Service
  5. Block deployment if any test fails

---

## Scripts (in root `package.json`)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server/src/app.js",
    "server": "nodemon server/src/app.js",
    "client": "cd client && react-scripts start",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
    "build": "cd client && react-scripts build",
    "test": "npm run test:client && npm run test:server",
    "test:client": "cd client && react-scripts test --watchAll=false",
    "test:server": "cd server && jest"
  }
}
```

---

## Deployment

- **Azure App Service**: Deploy the combined Node.js app (Express serves React build).
- **Environment Variables**: Support for `PORT` and `NODE_ENV`.
- **Pipeline YAML**: Includes install, test, build, and deploy steps.

---

## Deliverables

- Complete source code (client and server)
- Root-level `README.md` with setup, test, and deployment instructions
- Azure Pipelines YAML file for CI/CD
- Basic unit tests for both client and server

---

## Notes

- No authentication, database, or external API integration required.
- Use only open-source libraries.
- Keep code and documentation clear and concise.
